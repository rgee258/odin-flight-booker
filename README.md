## Flight Booker

This repo is used to host a simulated one-way flight booker using Rails.

A user will go through the process of selecting available flights according to their
preferred airport and date of travel. Once decided upon, they will be able to provide
their personal information and properly book their flight.

This application contains more advanced form concepts in Rails, such as nested forms
and usage of helpers such as select_tag. It was created for the purpose of learning
about them and putting them to practical use.

This project is done following The Odin Project, which this project in particular can
